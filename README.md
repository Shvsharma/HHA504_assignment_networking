# Networking in GCP and Azure - IPs and Domain Management

## Overview 

This project explores the networking features in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure, focusing on setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), mapping a custom domain to the IP, deploying a Flask web application, and configuring firewall settings to allow public access.

## Steps Performed

###  Networking in GCP - IPs and Domain Management

### 1. VPC Creation in GCP

### 2. DNS Configuration
- Acquired a domain via GitHub Student Pack (Namecheap).
- Configured DNS settings to map the static IP to the custom domain `shvsharma.me` and a subdomain `app.shvsharma.me`.
  - Added **A Record** for the root domain (`shvsharma.me`) pointing to the reserved static IP.
  - Added **A Record** for the subdomain (`app.shvsharma.me`) pointing to the same IP.

### 3. Created and Deployed Flask Application
- Deployed a Flask application on the GCP VM and ran it on port 5007.
- Flask code example:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def home():
      return "Hello from Flask app on GCP!"

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5007)

### 4. Configured Firewall Rules
-Configured GCP firewall rules to allow inbound traffic on port 5007 for the Flask application.

### 5. SSH into the VM
-Used SSH to connect to the VM and deploy the Flask application.

### 6. Accessing the Application
-Accessed the running Flask application via the custom domain: http://app.shvsharma.me:5007.

###  Networking in Azure - IPs and Domain Management

### 1. Set up Azure VM:
-A new VM was created in Azure with the required configurations to host the Flask web application.
-SSH access was configured, and I successfully connected to the VM.

### Conclusion
In this project, I successfully:

-Set up a VPC and reserved a static IP in GCP and Azure.

-Mapped a custom domain to the static IP.

-Deployed a Flask web application accessible via the custom domain.

-Configured firewall settings to allow public traffic on the required port.
